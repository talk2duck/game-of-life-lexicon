This zip file contains the source of Release 29 of the Life Lexicon,
a lexicon of terms used in Conway's Game of Life.

The source is unlikely to be of any use to most people, but is provided for
two reasons:
  (1) It will be of use to anyone who wishes to maintain the Lexicon in the
      future, should I for any reason cease to do so.
  (2) Some of it may be of use if anyone wants to convert the Lexicon into
      some other format.

The file supplied are:
    README               (this file)
    makehtml.sh          (a bash script to generate the HTML versions)
    htmlize.c            (C source for the `htmlize' program)
    perfect.c            (C source for the `perfect' program)
    head.htm             (the single-page HTML version of the introductory notes)
    tail.htm             (the single-page HTML version of the bibliography)
    ?.htm                (27 tiny files used for the multipage HTML version)
    top1.htm             (used at the top of the multipage HTML files)
    top2.htm             (also used at the top of the multipage HTML files)
    bot.htm              (used at the bottom of the multipage HTML files)
    lexicon.txt          (the ASCII version of the Lexicon)
    lexiconf.htm         (the frameset for the single-page HTML version)
    buttons.htm          (the button bar frame of the single-page HTML version)
    lex.htm              (the multipage HTML version of the introductory notes)
    lex_bib.htm          (the multipage HTML version of the bibliography)
    lifelex.el           (a Life Lexicon mode for Emacs)
    emacs.txt            (instructions for using lifelex.el)
    lifelex.css          (stylesheet for HTML versions)
    lexicon-no-wrap.txt  (version of lexicon.txt with no added newlines)
    lexicon-word-wrap.py (Python script to produce word-wrapped lexicon.txt)
    manual-edits.txt     (post-compile adjustments currently needed,
                             not yet integrated into perfect.c or htmlize.c)
    
The files htmlize.c and perfect.c should compile with any ANSI C compiler.
To compile with cygwin, use
   gcc -o perfect.exe perfect.c
   chmod ugo=rx perfect.exe
   gcc -o htmlize.exe htmlize.c
   chmod ugo=rx perfect.exe
   chmod ugo=rx makehtml.sh
   ./makehtml.sh
(The call to the makehtml bash script will run the other executables.)

The main body of the ASCII version is converted into HTML by `htmlize',
which generates files for both the single-page and the multipage versions.
In addition, the `perfect' program is used to remove extraneous bytes from
from lexicon.txt and ensure that it uses tabs in the way `htmlize' expects.
Extra HTML needs to be added to the beginning and end of the files
generated by `htmlize'.  You should study the bash script makehtml.sh
to see the details of the process.
